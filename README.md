# Music-Store-Data-Analysis

# Introduction:
The Music Store Data Analysis project is a SQL project that involves extracting valuable insights from a dataset containing information about music sales. This project allows us to identify the senior-most employee, which country and city had the highest sales, best customer, most popular genres, etc. The project also includes practicing a few questions ranging from easy to moderate difficulty levels.

# Project Files:
The project consists of a single Pdf file containing all the queries used to analyze the music store dataset.

# Project Setup:
To run this project, you will need a relational database management system (RDBMS) that supports SQL. I recommend using MySQL or PostgreSQL. Simply run the SQL queries in the SQL file against the database containing the music store dataset to extract the desired insights.
